// This is a placeholder repository interface. 
// For the current basic enrollment, logic might be directly in the service
// or interact with UserRepository and CourseRepository.
// This interface can be expanded if enrollment becomes a more complex entity.
export interface IEnrollmentRepository {
  // Example method if enrollment was an entity:
  // save(enrollment: EnrollmentEntity): Promise<void>;
  // findByUserIdAndCourseId(userId: string, courseId: string): Promise<EnrollmentEntity | null>;
